  <p class="pgetparagraphs">Reliance is what broke the market’s back on Monday and we are seeing a continuation of that trend with another 2% knock coming in for Reliance today as well. Why?
    I would say two reasons. Firstly, these are difficult times. The Covid recovery is not complete and difficult times remain for the refining as well as the retail sector and that has weighed down things dramatically for Reliance despite having one very well. 
    
    But structurally and also very importantly, the disclosure levels, essentially for gross refining margins is not there and the refining business is by far the largest business. Reliance has justified it saying that they want the market to look at it as a fully integrated operation from oil to chemicals rather than the intermediate refining. But since refining is the largest business -- whether it is an intermediate business or not and to take that away from 20 years of trends and analysis -- has not done any good from a disclosure level perspective. 
    
    The third thing is that the market itself got ahead. We downgraded Reliance about six months back because we really said that the market is assuming the consumer related businesses to be 30% CAGR growth sustaining over the next 10 years. It is a given that it is going to succeed and the fact of the matter is whatever one may say, at the net profit level attributable to Reliance industries, the consumer facing businesses -- Jio and retail -- make for only 25% of the bottomline</p>

  <p class="pgetparagraphs">On a monthly chart, Ford stock is breaking above its long-term downtrend going back to 1999. Looking at the weekly chart, shares have made a big move off 2020 lows. But Ford is now trading well below a key technical level, the 10-week line.
    As for the fundamentals, Ford sales and profits are rebounding. The company is moving more into electric vehicles, too. However, chip shortages are weighing on Ford and the entire auto industry.
    Bottom line: Ford stock is not a buy right now. It's trading below its 10-week line after earnings. A weekly close of more than 2% below that level is a decisive sell signal for position traders who purchased the stock at the flat-base breakout in January.
