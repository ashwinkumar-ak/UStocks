        <tr>
          <td class="ptmerits"><b class="tdpt">Takes advantage of a growing economy:</b> As the economy grows, so do corporate earnings. That's because economic growth creates jobs, which creates income, which creates sales. The fatter the paycheck, the greater the boost to consumer demand, which drives more revenues into companies' cash registers. ​​It helps to understand the phases of the business cycle—expansion, peak, contraction, and trough.</td>
        <td class="ptdemerits"><b class="tdpt">Risk:</b> You could lose your entire investment. If a company does poorly, investors will sell, sending the stock price plummeting. When you sell, you will lose your initial investment. If you can't afford to lose your initial investment, then you should buy bonds.

           You get an income tax break if you lose money on your stock loss. You also have to pay capital gains taxes if you make money.</td>
        </tr>
      
      <tr>
        <td class="ptmerits"><b class="tdpt">Best way to stay ahead of inflation:</b> Historically, stocks have averaged an annualized return of 10%. That's better than the average annualized inflation rate. It does mean you must have a longer time horizon. That way, you can buy and hold even if the value temporarily drops. </td>
      <td class="ptdemerits"><b class="tdpt">Stockholders paid last:</b> Preferred stockholders and bondholders/creditors get paid first if a company goes broke. But this happens only if a company goes bankrupt. A well-diversified portfolio should keep you safe if any one company goes under.</td>
      </tr>
     <tr>
       <td class="ptmerits"><b class="tdpt">Easy to buy:</b> The stock market makes it easy to buy shares of companies. You can purchase them through a broker, a financial planner, or online. Once you've set up an account, you can buy stocks in minutes. Some online brokers such as Robinhood let you buy and sell stocks commission-free.</td>
      <td class="ptdemerits"><b class="tdpt">Time:</b> If buying stocks on your own, you must research each company to determine how profitable you think it will be before you buy its stock. You must learn how to read financial statements and annual reports and follow your company's developments in the news. You also have to monitor the stock market itself, as even the best company's price will fall in a market correction, a market crash, or bear market.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="ptmerits"><b class="tdpt">Make money in two ways:</b> Most investors intend to buy low and then sell high. They invest in fast-growing companies that appreciate in value. That's attractive to both day traders and buy-and-hold investors. The first group hopes to take advantage of short-term trends, while the latter expect to see the company's earnings and stock price grow over time. They both believe their stock-picking skills allow them to outperform the market. Other investors prefer a regular stream of cash. They purchase stocks of companies that pay dividends. Those companies grow at a moderate rate.</td>
      <td class="ptdemerits"><b class="tdpt">Emotional roller coaster:</b> Stock prices rise and fall second-by-second. Individuals tend to buy high, out of greed, and sell low, out of fear. The best thing to do is not constantly look at the price fluctuations of stocks, just be sure to check in on a regular basis.</td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="ptmerits"><b class="tdpt">Easy to sell:</b> The stock market allows you to sell your stock at any time. Economists use the term "liquid" to mean you can turn your shares into cash quickly and with low transaction costs. That's important if you suddenly need your money in a hurry. Since prices are volatile, you run the risk of being forced to take a loss.</td>
    <td class="ptdemerits"><b class="tdpt">Professional competition:</b> Institutional investors and professional traders have more time and knowledge to invest. They also have sophisticated trading tools, financial models, and computer systems at their disposal. Find out how to gain an advantage as an individual investor.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ptmerits"><b class="tdpt">Highest returns:</b>Stocks have given the one of the highest historical returns among the various asset classes over the long term. If you’re looking for growth in your portfolio, investing in equity is usually the way to go.</td>
  <td class="ptdemerits"><b class="tdpt">Volatile in the short term:</b> Stock prices can rise or fall sharply because of an overreaction to good or bad news.This volatility makes stocks more risky than something like bonds.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
  <td class="ptmerits"><b class="tdpt">Income from dividends:</b> Many companies usually distribute a portion of its earnings to its shareholders. If you’re an investor looking for passive income, a dividend-growth strategy can pay off very handsomely.</td>
<td class="ptdemerits"><b class="tdpt">If you pick the wrong stock, you risk losing the value of your investment:</b> Similarly, a poor performing company can see its dividends fall or stagnate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="ptmerits"><b class="tdpt">Stocks are easily diversified:</b> You can invest in a number of stocks in different countries, sectors, and industries which gives you various growth opportunities and diversifies your risk.</td>
<td class="ptdemerits"><b class="tdpt">It takes knowledge and time to analyze a stock:</b> Not to say that having to analyze a stock is a bad thing (this is what separates successful investors from the rest anyway), but it simply requires more time and effort to pick the right stock as compared to picking the right savings plan for your money.</td>
